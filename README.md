# AccountsTheGathering
Business needs a view that displays user accounts by status.

# Description
The new accounts view will display user accounts sorted by status. The view will pull data from the vendor's REST API. Account statuses, due dates and amounts due should be calculated by the vendor. This feature is only for US users, so a currency type of USD can be inferred.
